		<h1>Kristopher’s Cabinet</h1>

		<img src="main.jpg" alt="">
		<p>
			Medium-density fiberboard and an Atom-based Windows PC are key components in this arcade cabinet, designed and built by members of the Game Development Club at San José State University.
			Students and faculty of the club have built five cabinets and their controls from the ground up to exhibit student-made games.
			The cabinets have been used in several art galleries, colleges, and street fairs.

			Game development drove my interest in Computer Science throughout high school and college, and I have been involved with the Game Dev Club since its early days in 2008.
			I have served as president, vice president, treasurer, and member at various times and made many games within the club.
			When the club faculty recently decided to downsize its cabinet fleet from five to two, I jumped on the chance to get my own.

			The game currently running is Ultrabreaker, a FreeBASIC project of 10k lines of code that has been through many rewrites since I started it in 2006.
			In late 2012 I finally released the source on GitHub and forked a custom version for this cabinet.

			The game currently running is Ramps Derp, a C++ / OpenGL / Box2D game co-developed with a friend during my last semester at SJSU.
			The world is procedurally generated and rendered with OpenGL primitives.
